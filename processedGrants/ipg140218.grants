The 3D display may be viewed by a person who is not wearing any special glasses. The flat screen device displays dynamically changing 3D imagery, with a refresh rate so fast that the device may be used for 3D movies or for interactive, 3D display. The flat screen device comprises a stack of LCD layers with two crossed polarization filters, one filter at each end of the stack. One or more processors control the voltage at each pixel of each LCD layer, in order to control the polarization state rotation induced in light at that pixel. The processor employs an algorithm that models each LCD layer as a spatially-controllable polarization rotator, rather than a conventional spatial light modulator that directly attenuates light. Color display is achieved using field sequential color illumination with monochromatic LCDs.",[Douglas Lanman][Gordon Wetzstein][Matthew Hirsch][Wolfgang Heidrich][Ramesh Raskar],[Massachusetts Institute of Technology],"This application is a non-provisional of, and claims the benefit of the filing date of, U.S. Provisional Application Ser.
