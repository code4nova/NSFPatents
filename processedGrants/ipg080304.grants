In one example, a nonlinear pulse oscillator is implemented as a closed loop structure that comprises a nonlinear transmission line, an improved high-pass filter, and a nonlinear amplifier configured to provide a self-adjusting gain as a function of an average voltage of the oscillator signal, to provide a pulse waveform having a desired target amplitude. In one implementation, the nonlinear amplifier and high pass filter functions are integrated in a two stage nonlinear amplifier/filter apparatus employing complimentary NMOS and PMOS amplification components and associated filtering and feedback circuitry configured to essentially implement an electric circuit analog of a saturable absorber via an adaptive bias control technique.",[David Ricketts][Xiaofeng Li][Donhee Ham],[President and Fellows of Harvard College],"The present application claims the benefit, under 35 U.S.C. &#xA7; 119(e), of U.S. Provisional Application Ser.

Multiple gratings spaced apart from each other are separated from an output aperture by a gain section. A relatively low coupling coefficient, κ, in the front grating reduces the added cavity loss for the back grating mode. Therefore, the back grating mode reaches threshold easily. The space section lowers the current induced thermal interaction between the two uniform grating sections, significantly reducing the inadvertent wavelength drift. As a result, a tunable mode pair separations (Δλ) as small as 0.3 nm and as large as 6.9 nm can be achieved.",[James J. Coleman][S.
