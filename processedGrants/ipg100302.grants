The techniques are designed to maintain constant modulus transmissions for uplink while effectively mitigating intersymbol interference. Specifically, the techniques utilize non-redundant unitary precoding across OFDMA subcarriers to maintain constant modulus transmissions for uplink communications. For example, the techniques involve precoding a block of information symbols and assigning a different subcarrier for each symbol of the block. The subcarriers are selected to be equi-spaced and may be selected, for example, from a phase-shift keying constellation. The number of symbols per block is equal to the number of subcarriers assigned per user.
