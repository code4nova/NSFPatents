13980068,20131114,20130303402,Detection and Molecular Weight Determination of Organic Vapors,"Composite films comprising an organic salt (or GUMBOS) such as 1-n-butyl-2,3-dimethylimidazolium hexafluoro-phosphate and a polymer such as cellulose acetate are prepared. These films are useful in detecting vapors of volatile organic compounds, and in determining their molecular weights. A quartz crystal microbalance-based sensor was designed by depositing a thin film of this composite material on the gold electrode surface of a quartz crystal resonator. The sensor exhibited rapid response toward a variety of volatile organic compounds, and complete regeneration, high sensitivity, low detection limits, and wide dynamic ranges. The ratio of the change in frequency to the change in motional resistance is a concentration-independent quantity that is proportional to the molecular weight of the absorbed chemical species. These properties facilitate the easy identification and molecular weight determination of a broad range of organic vapors.",[Isiah M. Warner][Bishnu P. Regmi][Bilal El-Zahab][Daniel J.

13813738,20131114,20130304258,MICRO-FORCE GUIDED COOPERATIVE CONTROL FOR SURGICAL MANIPULATION OF DELICATE TISSUE,A method and system for micro-force guided cooperative control that assists the operator in manipulating tissue in the direction of least resistance. A tool holder receives a surgical tool adapted to be held by a robot and a surgeon. A first sensor measures interaction forces between a tip of the surgical tool and tissue of a region of interest. A second sensor measures interaction forces between the surgeon and a handle to the surgical tool. A data processor is configured to perform an algorithm to actively guide the surgical tool by creating a bias towards a path of least resistance and limit directional tool forces of the surgical tool as a function of handle input forces and tip forces. This function offers assistance to challenging retinal membrane peeling procedures that require a surgeon to delicately delaminate fragile tissue that is susceptible to hemorrhage and tearing due to undesirable forces.,[Russell H.
