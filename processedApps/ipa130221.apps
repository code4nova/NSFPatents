13695251,20130221,20130042670,DETERMINATION OF PORE SIZE IN POROUS MATERIALS BY EVAPORATIVE MASS LOSS,A method for determination of pore-size distribution in a porous material called evapo porometry (EP) is capable of determining pore sizes from approximately the nanometer scale up to the micron scale. EP determines the pore size based on the evaporative mass loss at constant temperature from porous materials that have been pre-saturated with either a wetting or non-wetting volatile liquid. The saturated porous material is placed in an appropriate test cell on a conventional microbalance to measure liquid mass loss at a constant temperature as a function of time. The mass-loss rate is then related to the pore-size distribution. The microbalance permits measuring the mass as a function of time. The slope of the mass versus time curve is the evaporation rate. The evaporation rate is related to the vapor pressure at the interface between the liquid in the porous material and the ambient gas phase. The vapor pressure in turn is related to the pore diameter.,[Alan R. Greenberg][William B.

InP nanocrystals typically require post-generation HF treatment. Combining microwave methodologies with the presence of a fluorinated ionic liquid allows Fluorine ion etching without the hazards accompanying HF. Growing the InP nanocrystals in the presence of the ionic liquid allows in-situ etching to be achieved. The optimization of the PL QY is achieved by balancing growth and etching rates in the reaction.",[Geoffrey F. Strouse][Derek D.

The system includes a source of light with time-varying intensity directed at a scene to be imaged. A time-resolved light meter is provided for receiving light reflected from the scene to generate time-resolved samples of the intensity of light incident at the light meter. The temporal variation in the intensity of light incident at the light meter is associated with a function of a radiometric property of the scene, such as a linear functional of reflectance, and a computer processes the samples to construct a digital image. The spatial resolution of the digital image is finer than the spatial support of the illumination on the scene and finer than the spatial support of the sensitivity of the light meter. Using appropriate light sources instead of impulsive illumination significantly improves signal-to-noise ratio and reconstruction quality.",[Ghulam Ahmed Kirmani][Vivek K.
