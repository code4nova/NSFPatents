A microfluidic system is fabricated either directly on top of the IC chip, or as a separate entity that is then appropriately bonded to the IC chip, to facilitate the introduction and removal of cells in a biocompatible environment, or other particles/objects of interest suspended in a fluid. The patterned electric and/or magnetic fields generated by the IC chip can trap and move biological cells or other objects inside the microfluidic system. Electric and/or magnetic field generating components also may be controlled using signals of various frequencies so as to detect one or more cells, particles or objects of interest, and even the type of particle or object of interest, by measuring resonance characteristics associated with interactions between samples and one or more of the field-generating devices.

Inclusion of organic acids in the electrolyte solution leads to the incorporation into the nanotubes of up to 50 atom percent of carbon. In a two-stage method, a titanium anode is pre-patterned using a fluoride ion containing electrolyte and subsequently anodized in a chloride ion containing electrolyte to provide more evenly distributed nanotube arrays. The titania nanotubes have uses in composite materials, solar cells, hydrogen production, and as hydrogen sensors.",[Christiaan Richter][Latika Menon][Ronald J.

The output of the differential-input lowpass frequency selective circuit controls the gain matching of a phase noise cancellation path to minimize phase noise arising from quantization error associated with the sequence of divider modulus values in the fractional-N PLL. The two varactor capacitances add together in the VCO tank, so the VCO frequency depends on the common-mode loop filter voltage and is relatively insensitive to differential-mode voltage.

The central Authority maintains control over how and when shared secrets and data are used. In one embodiment, the secrets and data are protected by hardware-rooted encryption and cryptographic hashing, and can be stored securely in untrusted storage. The problem of transient trust and revocation of data is reduced to that of secure key management and keeping a runtime check of the integrity of the secure storage areas containing these keys (and other secrets). These hardware-protected keys and other secrets can further protect the confidentiality and/or integrity of any amount of other information of arbitrary size (e.g., files, programs, data) by the use of strong encryption and/or keyed-hashing, respectively. In addition to secrets the Authority owns, the system provides access to third party secrets from the computing devices. In one embodiment, the hardware-rooted encryption and hashing each use a single hardware register fabricated as part of the computing device's processor or System-on-Chip (SoC) and protected from external probing. The secret data is protected while in the device even during operating system malfunctions and becomes non-accessible from storage according to various rules, one of the rules being the passage of a certain time period. The use of the keys (or other secrets) can be bound to security policies that cannot be separated from the keys (or other secrets).

12549725,20100304,20100054164,Random Linear Network Coding for Time Division Duplexing,"A new random linear network coding scheme for reliable communications for time division duplexing channels is proposed. The setup assumes a packet erasure channel and that nodes cannot transmit and receive information simultaneously. The sender transmits coded data packets back-to-back before stopping to wait for the receiver to acknowledge (ACK) the number of degrees of freedom, if any, that are required to decode correctly the information. Provided herein is an analysis of this problem to show that there is an optimal number of coded data packets, in terms of mean completion time, to be sent before stopping to listen. This number depends on the latency, probabilities of packet erasure and ACK erasure, and the number of degrees of freedom that the receiver requires to decode the data. This scheme is optimal in terms of the mean time to complete the transmission of a fixed number of data packets. It is shown that its performance is very close to that of a full-duplex system, while transmitting a different number of coded packets can cause large degradation in performance, especially if latency is high. Also described herein is the throughput performance of the novel system and technique along with a comparison to existing half-duplex Go-back-N and Selective Repeat ARQ schemes.

Efficiency and convergence are assured by using measurement of object points to acquire initial estimates for refraction angles at the interface. Then, an optimization method is performed to get the optimized value of interface parameters. Last, based on the resulting interface parameters, 3-dimensional positions of object points in all the subsequent measurement could be reconstructed accurately.

Pathogenic microorganism activity is diminished through an impulsive stimulated Raman scattering process, that is, through the excitation of the low-energy vibrational state on the outer structure of a microorganism with femtosecond pulsed lasers. The wavelength of the laser pulses is in a range of the electromagnetic spectrum, for example, visible and near-infrared where water is substantially transparent. The method is utilized for cleansing blood components, disinfecting drinking water, treating viral and bacterial diseases, extracting nucleic acid from microorganisms, and for manufacturing vaccines.",[Kong-Thon Tsen][Shaw-Wei D.

When used with multiple light sources, the transformation may be used to produce a specular invariant image. A diffuse RGB image can be obtained by applying a non-linear partial differential equation to an RGB image to iteratively erode the specular component at each pixel. An optional third dimension of time may be added for processing video images. After the specular and diffuse components are separated, dichromatic editing may be used to independently process the diffuse and the specular components to add or suppress visual effects.

They are also able to self-renew indefinitely, sparking the hope they could be used as a source for large scale production of therapeutic cell lines. The present invention relates to a monolayer differentiation culture system that induces hESC (WA09 and BG01) to form epithelial sheets with mesodermal gene expression patterns (BMP4, RUNX1, GAT A4). These E-cadherin+ CD90lovv cells then undergo apparent epithelial-mesenchymal transformation (EMT) for the derivation of mesenchymal progenitor cells (hES-MC) that by flow cytometry are negative for hematopoietic (CD34, CD45 and CD 133) and endothelial (CD31 and CD 146) markers, but positive for markers associated with mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) (CD73, CD90, CD105 and CD166). To determine their functionality, we tested their capacity to produce the three lineages commonly associated with MSC and found they could form osteogenic and chondrogenic, but not adipogenic lineages. The derived hES-MC were able to remodel and contract collagen I lattice constructs to an equivalent degree as keloid fibroblast control cells and were induced to express αSMA when exposed to TGF-β1, but not PDGF-B. This data suggests the derived hES-MC cells are multipotent cells with potential uses in tissue engineering/regenerative medicine and for providing a highly reproducible cell source for adult-like progenitor cells.",[Steven Stice][Nolan Boyd],"","The present application claims priority from U.S. provisional application No. 60/932,328, entitled &#x201C;BMP4 Networks and hES-MSC Cultures&#x201D;, filed May 30, 2007, the entire contents of which is incorporated by reference in its entirety herein.",20080530,"The subject matter of the present application was supported by a grant from the National Science Foundation, grant no.

12727898,20100923,20100241378,Method and Apparatus for Compressive Parameter Estimation and Tracking,"We have developed a new method and apparatus for tracking and estimating parameters of locally oscillating signals from measurements that approximately preserve the inner product among signals in a class of signals of interest. Random demodulation, random sampling, and coset sampling are three prime examples of these techniques.One example of this is a compressive phase locked loops (PLL), which has a wide variety of applications, including but not limited to communications, phase tracking, robust control, sensing, and frequency modulation (FM) demodulation. The design modifies classical PLL designs to operate with CS-based sampling systems. By introducing a compressive sampler at the output of the oscillator and by appropriately adjusting the phase difference estimator we enable the use of PLLs with modern CS sampling technology. Other modifications can be made to reduce concerns such as normalization of the measurements, for example using the QCS-PLL.The concept of democracy is also introduced into a CS-PLL with quantization effects. Due to the universality of compressive measurements, we can drop a few saturated measurements, yet still get just as good or better performance than if we had allowed the quantizer to saturate.The CS-PLL and QCS-PLL enable one to track oscillating signals in very large bandwidths using a small number of measurements. In addition to potentially operating below the Nyquist rate, however, our new PLL designs offer very low computational complexity that does not involve intermediate compressive sensing signal reconstruction.",[Richard G.

These flexible modes may change over time, or vary between units of the same system. The variation in the modal dynamics may cause a degradation in performance or even instabilities unless compensated for by the control scheme. Controllers designed for these types of systems use notch filters for mode suppression. However variation in the parameters of the flexible modes may cause the need for wide notch filters. An adaptive scheme is proposed which uses an online estimator based on plant parameterization. The scheme may not use probe signals and may not rely on exact parameter identification of the unknown parameters. Instead it may continuously update itself to cancel the effect of the flexible modes by been able to identify the effect of the modal dynamics on the performance of the system. The adaptive notch filter can be designed narrower, adding less phase lag at lower frequencies, thereby allowing an increase in bandwidth and disturbance rejection capability.
